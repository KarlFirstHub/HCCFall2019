Chapter 10 Bookwork HTML Instructions

 

Make a ASG12_DMED_LAST_FIRST directory in your student folder  on the I drive.

Copy your chapter 10 starter files into this folder

 

In this chapter you will begin to learn how to control the positioning of your elements on the page.

 

Every element on the page (both block and inline), lives inside a box. This is actually called the "box model" and is the most fundamental way you can control positioning. Using the box model you can control:

 

margin - spacing between elements

border - draw a line around the element

padding - spacing between the border and the element's content

This "box model" concept is extremely important. If you don't understand it, the following chapters will not make much sense!

 

Steps to complete this chapter's HTML tasks:

 

You will be styling the lounge

Create and link the external style sheet lounge.css

Style the <body> including font size, font-family, line-height

Style text color for all headers, both <h1> & <h2>

Style font-size for <h1> & <h2> independently

Use an id to uniquely style the "guarantee" paragraph:

border color, width/thickness and style

background color and image (including repeat and positioning)

padding

margin

line-height

font style, family, color

Link a special style sheet for printing and use the media attribute to indicate device type

Validate your HTML at strict XHTML 1.0

Validate your CSS at CSS 2.1

Publish the chapter work to the HCC webdev server, place the folder on the H drive and turn in paper copies with cover sheet and comments and screen shots of the validation.
